Tim Ottinger and RMartin added the < and > link prefixes back in Feb.
The > prefix replaces the ^ prefix, which is deprecated.  >MyPage is now the
preferred way of linking to a subpage.

The < prefix is a search up the hierarchy.  <MyPage.YourPage hunts from the current page
up the hierarchy to first occurrence of MyPage.  Then it links to >YourPage from there.

Cleaned up a few odds and ends.  Changed MockWikiPage to WikiPageDummy to follow
Gerard's new nomenclature for Test Doubles.

Apparently there have been some fixes to timing and reentrancy bugs by Andreas and a few others.

Someone added an ant task to start fitnesse.  This means that in order to compile you have to
have the ANT jars in your classpath.
