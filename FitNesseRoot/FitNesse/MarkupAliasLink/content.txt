You can take any word, phrase, or image and turn it into a link using the following syntax:{{{
[[word or phrase][wikiPage]]}}}Here are some examples:

|!c Markup Text|!c Displayed as:|
|!-click [[here][.FrontPage]].-!|click [[here][.FrontPage]].|
|!-[[!img http://www.objectmentor.com/images/omLogo][http://www.objectmentor.com]]-!|[[!img http://www.objectmentor.com/images/omlogo][http://www.objectmentor.com]]|
|!-[[''Recent Changes''][RecentChanges]]-!|[[''Recent Changes''][RecentChanges]]|

 * When the text is a wiki word, the link to the wiki word takes precedence, so you cannot override one wiki word to link to another.

|!c Markup Text|!c Displayed as:|
|!-click [[RecentChanges][.FrontPage]].-!|click [[RecentChanges][.FrontPage]].|

 * When the link is a wiki word then, as usual, it is relative to the parent page unless preceded by a dot, in which case it is relative to the top. (See SubWiki for more details.)

|!c Markup Text|!c Displayed as:|
|!-click [[here][.FrontPage]].-!|click [[here][.FrontPage]].|
|!-click [[here][FrontPage]].-!|click [[here][FrontPage]].|
