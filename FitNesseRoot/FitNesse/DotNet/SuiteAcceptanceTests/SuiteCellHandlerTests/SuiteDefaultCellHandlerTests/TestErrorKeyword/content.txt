!3 Use the "error" keyword when you expect an error. In this case, an error turns the cell a nice shade of green!
----
This example uses a fixture that has string property and two string methods that throw errors - one that throws it directly and one that throws it by delegating to another method that throws an error. See the cells turn yellow when you specify a value
!|fit.ff.FixtureFixture|
|fixture|error throwing fixture|
||error throwing method()|error throwing property()|redirect to error throwing method()|
|eee|expecting|string|values|

When you use the error keyword and errors are received, however, the cells turn green.
