!3 BUG - when you define a classpath entry on a line immediately following a variable definition, the classpath entry is not procesed and the fixtures are therefore not found.
----

First, build a page with variable definitions followed immediately by a classpath definition. Also include a test that should pass.

!|script|
|start|Page Builder|
|line|!define PI {3.141592}|
|line|!path classes|
|line|!path fitnesse.jar|
|line|&bang;&bar;fitnesse.testutil.PassFixture&bar;|
|page|ClasspathTestPage|

Next, request that page with ?test (as though you clicked the test button)

!|Response Requester.|
|uri|valid?|contents?|
|!-ClasspathTestPage?test-!|true||

Lastly, ensure that the test passed.

!|Response Examiner.|
|type|pattern|matches?|value|
|contents|PassFixture|true||

!|Response Examiner.|
|type|pattern|matches?|
|contents|Exception|false|
