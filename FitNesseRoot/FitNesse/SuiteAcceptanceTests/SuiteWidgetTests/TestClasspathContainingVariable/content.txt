Classpath widgets can cantain variables.  The text of !path widgets do not get processed with exception of variable references.

Create a page that defines a variable used in a !path widget.
|script|
|start|Page Builder|
|line|!-!define BASE_PATH {/some/path/}-!|
|line|!-!path ${BASE_PATH}blah.jar-!|
|page|!-ClasspathTestPage-!|

Next, request that page with ?test (as though you clicked the test button)

|Response Requester.|
|uri|valid?|
|!-ClasspathTestPage-!|true|

Lastly, make sure the variable was rendered.
