!-FitDecorator-! is a framework for writing decorator for FIT fixtures. If you have exisiting fixtures which you don't want to or cannot update to add new functionality, some of the decorators might help. 

For example, if you want to approximately know how much time each fixture is taking during a fitnesse test, you can decorate the existing fitnesse table with a !-MaxTime-! decorator.

 * [[Measure Max Time taken by the Division Fixture by using !-MaxTime-! decorator][^MaxTimeDivision]]
 * [[Execute Division Fixture multiple times using Loop Decorator][^MultipleDivision]]
 * [[Example of piping !-MaxTime-! and Loop decorator to build complex decorators][^TimedMultipleDivision]]
 * [[Measure if the Division Fixture is executed in the given Time Range using the !-TimeRange-! decorator][^TimeRangeDivision]]
 * [[Copy the last row and append it to the end of the table 'n' number of times using !-CopyAndAppendLastRow-! decorator][^CopyAndAppendLastRow]]
 * [[Increment all the subsequent column values using the !-IncrementColumnsValues-! decorator][^IncrementColumnsValues]]
 * [[Example of piping !-CopyAndAppendLastRow-! and !-IncrementColumnsValues-! decorators][^CopyAppendLastRowAndIncrementColumnValues]]

'''Note:''' !-FitDecorator-! does not support [[Fit Library][http://fitlibrary.sourceforge.net]] as of now.
